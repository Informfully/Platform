# Informfully Platform

![Informfully](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Informfully/Documentation/main/docs/source/img/logo_banner.png)

Welcome to Informfully ([GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Informfully) & [Website](https://informfully.ch/))!
Informfully is an open-source research platform for content distribution and running user experiments.

The platform allows you to push algorithmically curated text, image, audio, and video content to users and automatically generates a detailed log of their consumption history.
It is a domain-agnostic and platform-independent solution to fit your specific needs.
The platform was designed to accommodate different experiment types through versatility, ease of use, and scalability.
It features three core components:

* a front end for displaying and interacting with recommended items,
* a back end for researchers to create and maintain user experiments, and
* a simple JSON-based exchange format for ranked item recommendations to interface with third-party services.

To view the full documentation, please visit [Informfully at Read the Docs](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/).
It is the combined documentation for all [code repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Informfully/repositories).

Find out more in the [Online Documentation](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app.html) and create your own instance by deploying the  [Platform Repository](https://github.com/Informfully/Platform).

## Installation Guide

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
In case you need more information about React Native, the most recent version of this guide is available [on the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app/blob/master/README.md).

The following installation instructions are an abbreviated version for quickly getting you set and ready.
You can access the full [Platform documentation here](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick.html).

### Download the Code

Informfully is a React Native app that uses Meteor servers as a back end.
Download the code and Meteor as follows:

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone https://github.com/Informfully/Platform.git

# Install all packages
cd backend
meteor npm install
```

After you have downloaded the code, you need to verify the React Native Packager Hostname. We have a small guide for Mac, Linux, and Windows. Find more on [Installation Instructions](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the documentation.

### Run the Code

Once everything is downloaded, all you need to do is run the back end and connect it with the front end. You can then start the server with:

```bash
# To run the server on port 3008
# Settings configured for the development environment...
./meteor-start.sh

# ...and...
bash meteor-start.sh

# ...or by specifying --port directly to run the server with
meteor --port 3008 --settings settings-dev.json
```

Make sure that you are specifying the same port for the back end that you are using in the [React Native App](https://github.com/Informfully/Platform/blob/main/frontend/App.js).
Find more on [Local Development](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html) in the documentation.

### Deploy the Code

After development and testing your instance of Informfully, you are ready to deploy your solution.
For your convenience, we have created a script that automatically deploys the back end to any local or cloud server.
Navigate to the main directory of your codebase and execute the following script:

```bash
# Deploy back end on the server
bash build.sh
```

Deployment of the front end is done via Google Play for Android and XCode for iOS.
Find more on [Back End Deployment](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html) and [Front End Deployment](https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/native.html) in the documentation.

### Download the App

Test versions are available to download if you want to have a quick look at the app.
